# Make changes:

1. Clone the Repo if you want to make changes.

   Download Ruby first if you are using a Windows laptop. Mac has Ruby pre-installed.
   Open the terminal/Command line and type: gem install sass to install sass.
   Open the terminal and go to the folder where contains sketch.scs and sketch.css.
   Type in terminal: sass --watch sketch.scss:sketch.css You will get your css file updated everytime you make changes on     your scss file.
  
3. Use the sublime Text to edit scss file and html

4. Commit the changes and sync
